# Console2048Fancy

This is a refresh of my [Console2048](https://github.com/IanWold/Console2048) project, but updated with new features in the latest C# and not constructed in one file.

The older project is written in a straightforward, imperative style probably better for learning the functionality of the game.

This newer project is architected and engineered a bit more "smartly", and uses a more functional style.
